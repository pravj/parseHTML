parseHTML
=========

a simple HTML Parser
<hr>


actually I was learning python and trying to write a script to Download Pictures from a website.<br>
On that website, pictures were arranged Category-wise, So some pictures in one Category-folder, <br>
and so on.

Then basically I had to scrape Page-Source.<br>
after fighting some time with <b>HTMLParser.py</b> and <b>BeautifulSoap.py,</b><br>
I thought about own script that can do the desired task
